<H1> Travel and Housing Logistics </H1>

<p id="travel">
  <strong>Getting to the field station and housing:</strong><br>
We have reserved the Landsnaes and Livingston cabins in Wawona, in <a href="http://snrs.ucmerced.edu/facilities">Yosemite National Park</a>.<br>
It takes about two hours to get to the cabins from Merced, via the Wawona entrance to the park (through Oakhurst). There is a map of the area on the SNRS website that will be useful to print out in advance.  Plan on arriving any time after 4pm. If you anticipate arriving after 10pm, please contact Jessica and she’ll let you know where to go.
<br>
When you arrive, please head up to the Landsnaes house and we will let you know which cabin/room you’ll be staying in.  Here is a link to the Google Maps location for the Landsnaes house, at 2667 English Ln: <a href="https://goo.gl/oad3RJ">map</a>. The Livingston cabin is just down the hill from Landsnaes, at 2644 English Lane.
<br>
A fee is usually required at the entrance to the park.
If you will be driving a car, and do not have a current National Parks pass, please contact the organizers for a fee waiver.
</p>
<br>
<p id="carpooling">
  <strong>Carpooling:</strong><br>

Carpooling is encouraged so that we can limit the number of cars at the cabin. To organize carpooling, please use this website: <a href="https://www.groupcarpool.com/t/3kuz6o">groupcarpool</a>. Add your car if you have spare seats, or add yourself to a car to catch a ride!
<br>
<strong>**NOTE: There is likely to be poor to no cell service! So print out the directions in advance, or make sure that you've already located the directions on Google maps, before you get out of reliable cell range.</strong>

</p>

<p id="housing">
  <strong>Staying at the Yosemite Field Station:</strong><br>

The cabins have sets of bunkbeds in each room, with shared bathroom.  All participants will need to bring their own bedding (sleeping bags or sheets/blankets and pillows) and their own bath and hand towels. If this presents a problem, let the organizers know and they can find supplies for you.<br>

From the Field Station website (see <a href="http://snrs.ucmerced.edu/facilities">snrs facilities</a> for more information):<br>
<i>What to Bring, What to Expect</i><br>
<ul>
<li>Bring your own linens, blankets, pillows, and towels.
</li><li>We have laundry facilities at the main station building.
</li><li>The kitchens are equipped with all the basics for cooking and eating.
</li><li>Most of the houses have a phone (local calls only) and wireless internet.
</li><li>There is little to no cell phone access in Wawona. Verizon maybe. AT&T no (Jessica’s experience- maybe)..
</li><li>There is a post office at the general store near the Wawona gas station.
</li>
</ul>
<i>Paying for housing</i><br>
The cost of the housing is $20/person/night. After the workshop, each of you will receive an individual invoice for the stay based on the number of nights you indicated you would be staying. There are a variety of payment options (cash, check, FAU), and we encourage you to ask your advisors to pay for the housing costs. You can pay for housing via FAU.
</p>
<br>
<p id="food">
  <strong>Food:</strong><br>

We will provide all meals, starting from dinner on Wednesday night through breakfast Saturday morning. If there’s something special to eat or drink that you want to bring or contribute, please do so. The houses are equipped with the standard suite of kitchen items.

If you want alcoholic beverages, then you’ll need to bring them yourselves.</p>
