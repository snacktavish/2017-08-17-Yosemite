# Background

You are all here today to learn how to code. Coding made me a better scientist because I was able to think more clearly about analyses, and become more efficient in doing so. Data scientists are creating tools that make coding more intuitive for new coders like us, and there is a wealth of awesome instruction and resources available to learn more and get help.

Here is an analogy to start us off. **If you were a pilot, R is an an airplane.** You can use R to go places! With practice you'll gain skills and confidence; you can fly further distances and get through tricky situations. You will become an awesome pilot and can fly your plane anywhere. 

And **if R were an airplane, RStudio is the airport**. RStudio provides support! Runways, communication and other services, and just makes your overall life easier. So although you can fly your plane without an airport and we could learn R without RStudio, that's not what we're going to do. 

> We are learning R together with RStudio and its many supporting features. 

Something else to start us off is to mention that you are learning a new language here. It's an ongoing process, it takes time, you'll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly awesome in the long run. We all speak at least one language; it's a similar process, really. And no matter how fluent you are, you'll always be learning, you'll be trying things in new contexts, etc, just like everybody else. And just like any form of communication, there will be miscommunications but hands down we are all better off because of it. 

While language is a familiar concept, programming languages are in a different context from spoken languages, but you will get to know this context with time. For example: you have a concept that there is a first meal of the day, and there is a name for that: in English it's "breakfast". So if you're learning Spanish, you could expect there is a word for this concept of a first meal. (And you'd be right: 'desayuno'). **We will get you to expect that programming languages also have words (called functions in R) for concepts as well**. You'll soon expect that there is a way to order values numerically. Or alphabetically. Or search for patterns in text. Or calculate the median. Or reorganize columns to rows. Or subset exactly what you want. We will get you increase your expectations and learn to ask and find what you're looking for.

OK, let's get going.

This lesson is a combination of excellent lessons by others (thank you Jenny Bryan and Data Carpentry!) that I have combined and modified for our workshop today. I definitely recommend reading through the original lessons and using them as reference:

# R at console, RStudio goodies

Launch RStudio/R.

Notice the default panes:

  * Console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: [Customizing RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio). 

There are other great features we don't really have time for today as we walk through the IDE together. (IDE stands for integrated development environment.) Check out the [webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) and [RStudio IDE cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for more. (And this is my blog post about [RStudio Awesomeness](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/)).

Go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process.

Make an assignment and then inspect the object you just created.

```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
x
```
In my head I hear, e.g., "x gets 12".

All R statements where you create objects -- "assignments" -- have this form: `objectName <- value`.  

I'll write it in the command line with a hashtag `#`, which is the way R comments so it won't be evaluated. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# objectName <- value

## this is also how you write notes in your code to explain what you are doing.
```

Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. You will be wise to adopt a [convention for demarcating words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) in names.

```{r}
# i_use_snake_case
# other.people.use.periods
# evenOthersUseCamelCase
```

Make an assignment
```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
```

To inspect this variable, instead of typing it, we can press the up arrow key and call your command history, with the most recent commands first. Let's do that, and then delete the assignment: 

```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name
```

Another way to inspect this variable is to begin typing `this_`...and RStudio will automagically have suggested completions for you that you can select by hitting the tab key, then press return. 

And another way to inspect this is by looking at the Environment pane in RStudio. 

```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name
```

One more:
```{r}
science_rocks <- 2
```

Let's try to inspect:
```{r}
sciencerocks
```

Implicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. You'll need to pay attention to how you type.

Remember that this is a language, not unsimilar to English! There are times you aren't understood -- it's going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you'll get an error. This is like someone saying 'What?' or 'Pardon'? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say 'I didn't understand this specific part of what you said, I was expecting something else'. That is a great type of error message. Error messages are your friend. Google them (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean. 

`r img(src='img/practicalDev_googleErrorMessage.jpg', width=400)`

And also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I'm telling a story about tables and you're picturing where you eat breakfast and I'm talking about data. This can leave me thinking I've gotten something across that the listener (or R) interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused... So write clean code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances!

A moment about **logical operators and expressions**. We can ask questions about the objects we just made. 

- `==` means 'is equal to'
- `!=` means 'is not equal to'
- `<` means ` is less than'
- `>` means ` is greater than'
- `<=` means ` is less than or equal to'
- `>=` means ` is greater than or equal to'
```{r}
science_rocks == 2
science_rocks <= 30
science_rocks != 5
```

> Shortcuts
You will make lots of assignments and the operator `<-` is a pain to type. Don't be lazy and use `=`, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize **RStudio's keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign)**.
Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds `<-` with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces.
RStudio offers many handy [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts). Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.

> My most common shortcuts include command-Z (undo), and combinations of arrow keys in combination with shift/option/command (moving quickly up, down, sideways, with or without highlighting.

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of
other variables.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
variable, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

## R functions, help pages

R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are accessed like so
```{r eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
# function_name(argument1 = my_first_argument, argument2 = my_second_argument...)
```

Let's try using `seq()` which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we're at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio.

Type `se` and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify `seq()` by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function's arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. 

Type the arguments `1, 10` and hit return. 
```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```

We could probably infer that the `seq()` function makes a sequence, but let's learn for sure. Type (and you can autocomplete) and let's explore the help page:

```{r}
?seq 
help(seq) # same as ?seq
seq(from = 1, to = 10) # same as seq(1, 10); R assumes by position
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
```

The above also demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. You can always specify in `name = value` form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence `from = 1` that goes `to = 10`. Since we didn't specify step size, the default value of `by` in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first
argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use `name = value`.


The help page tells the name of the package in the top left, and broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

The examples can be copy-pasted into the console for you to understand what's going on. Remember we were talking about expecting there to be a function for something you want to do? Let's try it. `min()`, `max()`, `log()`...

> Exercise: Talk to your neighbor(s) and look up the help file for a function you know. Try the examples, see if you learn anything new. (need ideas? `?getwd()`, `?plot()`, `?mean()`, `?log()`).

Help for when you only sort of remember the function name: double-questionmark:
```{r}
??install 
```


Not all functions have (or require) arguments:
```{r}
date()
```

Now look at your workspace -- in the upper right pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. You can also get a listing of these objects with commands:

```{r}
objects()
ls()
```

If you want to remove the object named `weight_kg`, you can do this:

```{r}
rm(weight_kg)
```

To remove everything:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

or click the broom in RStudio's Environment pane.

> Exercise: Clear your workspace, then create a few new variables. Create a variable that is the mean of a sequence of 1-20. What's a good name for your variable? Does it matter what your 'by' argument is? Why?

# Working directories, RStudio projects, scripts

So we will talk about scripts in a moment, but first let's talk about where they should live. 

*We're not going to cover workspaces today, but this is another alternative to scripts. You can learn about it in this RStudio article: [Working Directories and Workspaces](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711843-Working-Directories-and-Workspaces).*


### Working directory

Any process running on your computer has a notion of its "working directory". In R, this is where R will look, by default, for files you ask it to load. It is also where, by default, any files you write to disk will go. You have a sense of this because whenever you go to save a Word doc or download, it asks where. You often have to navigate to put it exactly where you want it. There are a few ways to check your working directory in RStudio.

You can explicitly check your working directory with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```
It is also displayed at the top of the RStudio console.

As a beginning R user, it's OK let your home directory or any other weird directory on your computer be R's working directory. _Very soon_, I urge you to evolve to the next level, where you organize your analytical projects into directories and, when working on Project A, set R's working directory to Project A's directory.

You can set R's working directory at the command line like so. You could also do this in a script.

```{r eval = FALSE}
setwd("~/myCoolProject")
```

But there's a better way. A way that also puts you on the path to managing your R work like an expert.

## RStudio projects

Keeping all the files associated with a project organized together -- input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures -- is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via its _projects_. More here: [Using Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

Let's make one to use for the rest of today. 

> Do this: File > New Project ... New Directory > Empty Project. The directory name you choose here will be the project name. Call it whatever you want (or follow me for convenience).

I created a directory and, therefore RStudio project, called `data-carpentry` in a folder called `tmp` in my home directory, FYI.
What do you notice about your RStudio pane? Look in the right corner--'data-carpentry'.

Now check that the "home" directory for your project is the working directory of our current R process:

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
# "/Users/julialowndes/tmp/data-carpentry" 
```

**About paths**: The above is the absolute path: it starts at the `/Users` root and is specific to my computer (`julialowndes`) and where I saved it. So if I did an analysis with this filepath, it wouldn't work on your computer before you altered the filepath. 

But with an RStudio project, your paths within this project can be relative, which means they *start* in the `data-carpentry` folder, wherever it is. So we can just use filepaths within our project from a relative place, and it can work on your computer or mine, without worrying about the absolute paths. (Analogy: I can give you directions from this building to the pub, since we're all here in this shared space already. I can't give you all directions from your home to this building and then the pub, because you all live in different places. But I can give directions relative to this building). 


## Create an R script

It's been great to play around in the console, but we are really here to focus on reproducible analyses, and that means saving our work in a script that can be rerun. Create a new R script by going to File > New File > R Script or going to the little plus at the top left of the RStudio console. Put a comment at the top of this script for now:  

```{r}
## my_script.R
## Julie Lowndes lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu
```

Click on the floppy disk to save. Give it a name ending in `.R` or `.r`, and use no spaces in the name. I named mine `my-script.r` and note that, by default, it will go in the directory associated with your project. It is traditional to save R scripts with a `.R` or `.r` suffix. 

## Create a data folder

Let's also create a folder in our Project called 'data' (all lowercase). You can do this in your Finder/Windows Explorer as you would normally, or you can do it from RStudio, using the Files tab in the bottom right pane. 


## Download and save our data

We will use the `download.file()` function to download data from figshare online. Let's look up `?download.file()` in the help first.   

Let's run this. Unlike when we typed in the console, hitting 'enter'/'return' won't execute the command; we've essentially just written it in a text file. So to execute it, we'll have to press the 'Run' button in the top right of the editor pane, or a shortcut is command-enter.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              "data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

A few things to note with the above: the function call is written across 2 lines: R is OK with extra white space, and will even indent so it's easier to read.

Once you run this, you should see the file appear in the data folder.

## Explore the data

Let's read the data into R and save it to a variable called `surveys`. Type this into your script. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## read in the data
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```


Now, we are going to start exploring data. Click on 'surveys' in the environment pane. 

We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in our study
area. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxa             | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |


Let's try this without using the mouse, we can type commands in our script too. Type `surveys` and execute this line by pressing 'Run' or command-return.

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(surveys)
```

### What are data frames?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting. Ours is actually a tibble, which is robust type of dataframe.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because the column are
vectors, they all contain the same type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising of a
numeric, a character and a logical vector.


We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```

### Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

Explore content:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## explore content
head(surveys) # first 6 rows
tail(surveys) # last 6 rows
tail(surveys, 10) # last 10 rows
```

Summaries:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## summaries
str(surveys) # structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of  each column
summary(surveys) # summary statistics for each column
```

Explore size:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## size
dim(surveys) # number of rows and the number of columns (the dimensions)
nrow(surveys) # number of rows
ncol(surveys) # number of columns
```

Explore names:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## names
names(surveys) # column names 
```

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.


> ### Challenge
>
> Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

### Clean up our R script. 
Here is what mine looks like: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## my_script.R
## Julie Lowndes lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu

## load readr library
library(readr) # install.packages('readr')

## read in the data
surveys <- readr::read_csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169")


## explore content
head(surveys) # first 6 rows
tail(surveys) # last 6 rows
tail(surveys, 10) # last 10 rows

## summaries
str(surveys) # structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of  each column
summary(surveys) # summary statistics for each column

## size
dim(surveys) # number of rows and the number of columns (the dimensions)
nrow(surveys) # number of rows
ncol(surveys) # number of columns

## names
names(surveys) # column names 
```


### Remember...

This workflow will serve you well in the future:

  * Create an RStudio project for an analytical project
  * Keep inputs there (although we didn't save data locally, we put it directly into the R workspace for now)
  * Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole from there
  * Keep outputs there (we'll do that tomorrow)

**Avoid using the mouse for pieces of your analytical workflow**, such as loading a dataset or saving a figure. This is terribly important for reproducility and for making it possible to retrospectively determine how a numerical table or PDF was actually produced (searching on local disk on filename, among `.R` files, will lead to the relevant script).
